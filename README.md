# Godot FFT-Water
Simulates an ocean surface using the JONSWAP frequency spectrum and the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (inverse FFT) in Godot. The water simulation is continous, however the gif below is 10 seconds long.

> Because of this, the project has not been finalized. Further performance optimization, organization and cleanup is certainly necessary.
